## Data Availability
The code and data provided in this repository is meant to be accessed, viewed, tested, and reused by manuscript reviewers and readers. Most of the [data](https://github.com/lingjunli-research/pgc-glycosylation-lfq/blob/main/N_Glycosylation_Results) has been provided alongside the code. However, the raw and mzxml files needed to recreate some items must be accessed from the [ProteomeXchange Consortium](http://www.proteomexchange.org/). Unique accession information will be provided, following publication. If you experience any trouble in accessing or running this code, please contact me using the information below. 


## Getting Started
This repo uses python and jupyter notebooks. If you do not have either of these installed, please read further [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).


Easiest way to use these notebooks is to clone/fork the repo and then install requirements.
```
git clone https:/github.com/lingjunli-research/pgc-glycosylation-lfq

# navigate to the new directory
cd C:/user/some/path/to/directory/pgc-glycosylation-lfq

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Use
This code is provided 'as is' and may be modified for personal use. If you are interested in learning more about the main packages used throughout, I would suggest reading more on [Pyteomics](https://pyteomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/).
